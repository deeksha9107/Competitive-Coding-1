# Min Heap Implementation using Array
# # // Time Complexity :
# # // Space Complexity :
# # // Did this code successfully run on Leetcode :
# # // Any problem you faced while coding this :


# # // Your code here along with comments explaining your approach

# Step 1: Read Question
# Step 2: Constraints
# Step 3: Test Cases
#         [0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7] --> 2
#         [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9] --> 8
#         [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] --> 8
# Step 4: Solution without Code
#         Brute Force: Linear Search
#         Optimised: Binary Search --> finding the difference between the index and the num[i]
#         else go where missing high = mid - 1
# Step 5: Code the solution
